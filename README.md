# PASD
**Passive Agressive Slam Detector**

A small arduino project to detect when a door slams hard enough to bother those around it.

# Why?
In our company we have a faulty self closing door that doesn't close it "gracefully".

The slamming sound bothers those (myself included) nearby.

Some people notice that and hold the door so it closes slowly, but **others don't ~~CARE~~ notice it!**.

So, to help those people see how it bothers us, we thought about this project.

# TODO

## MVP
- [ ] Hear sound with arduino
- [ ] Check for a sound threshold
- [ ] Blink when it passes

## V2
- [ ] Connect to wifi
- [ ] Save slam information to database somewhere
- [ ] Make our slack bot read that and inform when asked

## V3 (probably nothing involving the arduino anymore)
- [ ] Stats using the information saved
